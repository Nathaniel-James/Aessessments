• The purpose of the program 

The purpose of the program is to display how a simple point of sale system operates. The program manages its products, check stock availability,
allows user to add, remove and view the items in  the cart. Additionally, it processes payment, apply discounts if necessary and generates receipts
after payment.



• How to run the program
The program has a pre-defined product menu with all the products that the retail store sells, as well as, their respective price and 
stock quantities. The cashier/user would input the name and quantity of the product required by the buyer, which is then added to the cart 
for check-out. Whenever a product is added to the users' cart, the stock quantity of the product is reduced, and once the item has a stock
quantity of less than 5, a low stock alert message is displayed to the cashier/user.


• Required modifications
In the technological era that were living in, the program can be modified to facilitate the option of making payments with a credit or debit card,
which is the payment method preferred by many individuals.




• And any assumptions or limitations regarding its operation.
We can assume that the point of sale system can function with or without network connectivity. However, the stock quantity would update in real time when it is
connected to the internet, however, if there is no internet connection, the stock quantity would still update but will take a longer time to update the system.
